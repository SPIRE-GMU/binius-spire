# Arbitrary IANTT with throughput 10 Gb/s

This is a lazy prototype for anyone who have interests in reproducing the architecture in HLS, rather than build a complex (PL + PS + Host) system. It may differ in frequency but always around 300 MHz after synthesis. Chooes one of the src file and test, or you can extend to a longer length.
